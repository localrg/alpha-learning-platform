## Tier System

The tier system provides recognition at different ranking levels:

| Tier | Rank Range | Badge | Color | Description |
|------|-----------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Champion | #1 | 👑 | Gold | Top student |
| Master | #2-3 | ⚡ | Silver | Podium finishers |

This creates **multiple achievement levels** so students at all ranks feel recognized.

---

## Ranking Mechanics

### Ordering Rules

**Primary Sort:** Metric value (descending)  
**Tie-Breaker:** Student ID (ascending)  
**Rank Assignment:** Sequential (1, 2, 3, ...)

### Percentile Calculation

```
Percentile = (Rank / Total Students) × 100
```

Example: Rank #5 out of 100 students = Top 5%

### Nearby Students

The "nearby students" feature shows students ranked close to the current student:

**Range:** ±5 ranks (configurable)  
**Purpose:** Show achievable goals and close competition  
**Example:** Student at rank #47 sees ranks #42-52

## Social Comparison Psychology

### Upward Comparison

Seeing higher-ranked students motivates improvement and provides aspirational goals.

**Example:** Rank #47 sees rank #42 and thinks "I can get there!"

### Downward Comparison

Seeing lower-ranked students boosts confidence and validates progress.

**Example:** Rank #47 sees rank #52 and feels accomplished.

### Similar-Rank Comparison

Nearby students create achievable, motivating goals.

**Strategy:** "Nearby students" feature shows ±5 ranks for healthy competition.

### Multiple Dimensions

Different leaderboards recognize different types of success:
- **XP:** Overall effort and engagement
- **Skills:** Learning breadth and mastery
- **Achievements:** Diverse accomplishments

This ensures all students can excel in at least one dimension.

---

## Motivational Design

### Positive Framing

**Percentile Display:** "Top 25%" sounds better than "Rank #25"

**Tier Badges:** Everyone gets a badge, not just top 3

**Multiple Leaderboards:** Multiple chances to rank high

### Healthy Competition

**Grade-Level Boards:** Fair comparison with similar-age peers

**No Negative Messaging:** No "You're losing!" or "Last place!"

**Refresh Control:** Students choose when to check rankings

### Recognition at All Levels

**Champion (Top 1):** Highest recognition  
**Master (Top 3):** Podium recognition  
**Expert (Top 10):** Elite recognition  
**Intermediate (Top 25):** Above-average recognition  
**Beginner (Everyone):** Participation recognition
