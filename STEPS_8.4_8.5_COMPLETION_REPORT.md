## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Completion Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Test Results:** 20/20 tests passed ✅

## Overview

Steps 8.4 and 8.5 successfully implement the final features of the Parent Portal: communication tools for parent-teacher messaging and goal-setting capabilities for collaborative learning objectives. These features complete the parent engagement ecosystem and enable three-way communication between students, parents, and teachers.

## Implementation Summary

### Step 8.4: Communication Tools

#### Database Models (`backend/src/models/parent_communication.py`)

**ParentTeacherMessage Model:**
- Parent-teacher messaging with threading support
- Message types: question, inquiry, concern, meeting, appreciation
- Read/unread tracking for both parties
- Reply threading (replied_to_id)
- Student context for all messages

#### CommunicationService (`backend/src/services/communication_service.py`)

**Methods (6):**
1. `send_message()` - Send message from parent to teacher
2. `reply_to_message()` - Reply to existing message
3. `get_messages()` - Get all messages (inbox + sent)
4. `get_message()` - Get specific message with thread
5. `mark_as_read()` - Mark message as read
6. `get_unread_count()` - Get count of unread messages

**Features:**
- Authorization verification (parent-child link)
- Teacher verification (student must be in teacher's class)
- Message threading (conversations)
- Read/unread tracking
- Message filtering (all, unread, sent)

#### API Routes (`backend/src/routes/communication_routes.py`)

**Endpoints (6):**
- `POST /api/parent/messages` - Send message
- `POST /api/parent/messages/<id>/reply` - Reply to message
- `GET /api/parent/messages` - Get all messages
- `GET /api/parent/messages/<id>` - Get message with thread
- `PUT /api/parent/messages/<id>/read` - Mark as read
- `GET /api/parent/messages/unread-count` - Get unread count

### Step 8.5: Goal Setting

#### Database Models (`backend/src/models/parent_communication.py`)

**Goal Model:**
- 6 goal types: skill_mastery, practice_time, accuracy, assignments, streak, custom
- Automatic progress tracking for 5 types
- Manual updates for custom goals
- Status: active, completed, abandoned
- Due dates (optional)
- Progress percentage calculation

**GoalNote Model:**
- Encouragement and feedback from parents/students/teachers
- Timestamped notes
- User attribution

**GoalProgress Model:**
- Historical progress tracking
- Automatic and manual updates
- Progress snapshots with notes

#### GoalService (`backend/src/services/goal_service.py`)

**Methods (10):**
1. `create_goal()` - Create new goal with authorization
2. `get_student_goals()` - Get all goals for student
3. `get_goal()` - Get goal with notes and progress history
4. `update_goal()` - Update goal (if not completed)
5. `delete_goal()` - Delete goal
6. `add_note()` - Add encouragement/feedback
7. `add_manual_progress()` - Manual progress update (custom goals)
8. `_update_goal_progress()` - Automatic progress tracking
9. `update_all_active_goals()` - Update all goals after activity

**Automatic Tracking:**
- **Skill Mastery:** Tracks LearningPath accuracy and mastery
- **Practice Time:** Calculates time from StudentSessions
- **Accuracy:** Computes overall accuracy from sessions
- **Assignments:** Counts completed AssignmentStudent records
- **Streak:** Reads current streak from StreakTracking
- **Custom:** Manual updates only

#### API Routes (`backend/src/routes/goal_routes.py`)

**Endpoints (7):**
- `POST /api/goals` - Create goal
- `GET /api/goals/student/<id>` - Get student goals
- `GET /api/goals/<id>` - Get specific goal
- `PUT /api/goals/<id>` - Update goal
- `DELETE /api/goals/<id>` - Delete goal
- `POST /api/goals/<id>/notes` - Add note
- `POST /api/goals/<id>/progress` - Add manual progress
