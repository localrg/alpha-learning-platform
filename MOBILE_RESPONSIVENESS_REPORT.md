## Responsive Design Strategy

### Mobile-First Approach

The platform is built using a mobile-first design methodology, where the base styles are optimized for mobile devices and progressively enhanced for larger screens. This ensures optimal performance and user experience on mobile devices, which represent the majority of users.

### Breakpoint Strategy

The platform uses three primary breakpoints to accommodate different device sizes:

| Tablet | 768px - 1024px | Tablets, phones (landscape) | Two-column where appropriate |
| Desktop | > 1024px | Laptops, desktops | Multi-column, sidebar layouts |

### Fluid Typography

Text sizes scale smoothly across breakpoints using relative units (rem, em) and CSS clamp() for optimal readability:

- **Mobile:** Base font size 14px-16px
- **Tablet:** Base font size 15px-17px
- **Desktop:** Base font size 16px-18px
