## Business Logic

### Status Determination

```python
def get_student_status(student_id):
    # Get metrics
    accuracy = get_avg_accuracy(student_id)
    days_inactive = get_days_inactive(student_id)
    overdue_count = get_overdue_assignments(student_id)
    
    # Determine status
    if days_inactive > 14:
        return 'inactive'
    elif accuracy < 0.7 or days_inactive > 7 or overdue_count >= 3:
        return 'needs_help'
    elif accuracy < 0.8 or days_inactive > 3 or overdue_count > 0:
        return 'needs_practice'
    else:
        return 'on_track'
```

### Alert Generation

```python
def generate_alerts(class_id):
    alerts = []
    
    for student in class_students:
        # Inactivity alerts
        if days_inactive >= 7:
            alerts.append({
                'severity': 'high',
                'type': 'inactive',
                'message': f'{student.name} inactive for {days_inactive} days',
                'action': 'Send reminder'
            })
        
        # Performance alerts
        if accuracy < 0.6:
            alerts.append({
                'severity': 'high',
                'type': 'low_performance',
                'message': f'{student.name} accuracy at {accuracy:.0%}',
                'action': 'Create targeted assignment'
            })
        
        # Assignment alerts
        if overdue_count >= 3:
            alerts.append({
                'severity': 'high',
                'type': 'overdue_assignments',
                'message': f'{student.name} has {overdue_count} overdue assignments',
                'action': 'Message student'
            })
    
    # Sort by severity
    alerts.sort(key=lambda x: priority_order[x['severity']])
    return alerts
```

### Session Tracking

```python
def track_session_activity(student_id, skill_id, question_id, correct):
    # Get or create active session
    session = get_active_session(student_id) or create_session(student_id, skill_id)
    
    # Update session
    session.questions_answered += 1
    if correct:
        session.questions_correct += 1
    session.accuracy = session.questions_correct / session.questions_answered
    session.last_activity_at = datetime.utcnow()
    
    db.session.commit()
    return session
```

---

## Database Schema

```sql
-- Student sessions table
CREATE TABLE student_sessions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES students(id),
    skill_id INTEGER REFERENCES skills(id),
    started_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_activity_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    questions_answered INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    questions_correct INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    accuracy FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    ended_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_session_student ON student_sessions(student_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_session_active ON student_sessions(is_active);
CREATE INDEX idx_session_last_activity ON student_sessions(last_activity_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_session_skill ON student_sessions(skill_id);
```

## What's Next: Steps 7.4 & 7.5

The remaining Week 7 steps will build on this monitoring foundation:

**Step 7.4: Performance Analytics (Combined with 7.5)**
- Detailed performance reports
- Trend analysis and visualizations
- Class comparisons
- Skill mastery tracking
- Progress over time charts

**Step 7.5: Intervention Tools (Combined with 7.4)**
- Quick message to student
- Create targeted assignment
- Schedule meeting
- Notify parent
- Assign peer tutor

**Note:** Steps 7.4 and 7.5 will be combined into a single implementation as they are closely related and build on the monitoring system.

2. **Status categories simplify complexity** - 4 categories easier than raw metrics
3. **Alerts must be actionable** - Every alert includes recommended action
4. **Priority matters** - High/medium/low helps teachers focus
5. **Session tracking enables intervention** - Knowing when students practice enables timely help
6. **Inactive detection is critical** - Many students drop out silently
7. **Authorization is essential** - Teachers can only see their classes
