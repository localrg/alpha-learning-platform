## Technical Notes

### Role-Based Authorization

```python
@teacher_bp.route('/dashboard', methods=['GET'])
@token_required
def get_dashboard(current_user):
    """Get teacher dashboard data"""
    # Verify user is a teacher
    if current_user.role != 'teacher':
        return jsonify({'error': 'Not authorized'}), 403
    
    result, status = TeacherService.get_dashboard_data(current_user.id)
    return jsonify(result), status
```

### Metrics Calculation

```python
def get_class_metrics(class_id):
    """Calculate metrics for a class"""
    # Get all students in class
    memberships = ClassMembership.query.filter_by(class_id=class_id).all()
    student_ids = [m.student_id for m in memberships]
    
    # Get learning paths for all students
    paths = LearningPath.query.filter(LearningPath.student_id.in_(student_ids)).all()
    
    # Calculate averages
    total_accuracy = sum(p.current_accuracy for p in paths)
    avg_accuracy = total_accuracy / len(paths) if paths else 0
    
    # Identify struggling students
    struggling_students = []
    for student_id in student_ids:
        student_paths = [p for p in paths if p.student_id == student_id]
        if student_paths:
            student_accuracy = sum(p.current_accuracy for p in student_paths) / len(student_paths)
            if student_accuracy < 0.7:
                struggling_students.append(student_id)
    
    return {
        'avg_accuracy': round(avg_accuracy, 2),
        'struggling_students': struggling_students,
        ...
    }
```

### Auto-Create Teacher Profile

```python
def get_dashboard_data(user_id):
    """Get comprehensive dashboard data for teacher"""
    # Get teacher profile
    teacher = Teacher.query.filter_by(user_id=user_id).first()
    if not teacher:
        # Create teacher profile if doesn't exist
        user = User.query.get(user_id)
        if not user or user.role != 'teacher':
            return {'error': 'Not a teacher account'}, 403
        
        teacher = Teacher(
            user_id=user_id,
            name=user.username,
            email=user.email or f'{user.username}@school.edu'
        )
        db.session.add(teacher)
        db.session.commit()
    
    # Continue with dashboard data...
```

### Status Determination

```python
def _get_student_performance(student_id):
    """Get performance data for a student"""
    # Calculate average accuracy
    paths = LearningPath.query.filter_by(student_id=student_id).all()
    avg_accuracy = sum(p.current_accuracy for p in paths) / len(paths)
    
    # Determine status
    if avg_accuracy >= 0.8:
        status = 'on_track'
    elif avg_accuracy >= 0.7:
        status = 'needs_practice'
    else:
        status = 'needs_help'
    
    return {
        'avg_accuracy': round(avg_accuracy, 2),
        'status': status,
        ...
    }
```

## Database Schema

```sql
-- New table
CREATE TABLE teachers (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES users(id),
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
    school VARCHAR(200),
    subject VARCHAR(100),
    grade_levels VARCHAR(50),
    bio TEXT,
    avatar VARCHAR(200) DEFAULT '👨‍🏫',
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Modified table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'student';

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_teacher_user ON teachers(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_role ON users(role);
```
