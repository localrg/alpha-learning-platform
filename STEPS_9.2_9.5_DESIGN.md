# Steps 9.2-9.5: Advanced Analytics Features - Design Document

## Overview

Steps 9.2-9.5 implement the remaining advanced analytics features: predictive modeling, personalized recommendations, comparative analytics, and export tools. These features build on the analytics dashboard to provide deeper insights and actionable intelligence.

## Step 9.2: Predictive Performance Modeling

### Goals
- Predict student outcomes (will they master a skill?)
- Forecast assignment completion likelihood
- Identify at-risk students before they fall behind
- Estimate time to mastery for skills

### Features

**Skill Mastery Prediction:**
- Input: current accuracy, questions answered, practice frequency
- Output: probability of mastery (0-100%), estimated days to mastery
- Algorithm: Linear regression on accuracy trend + practice consistency

**Assignment Completion Prediction:**
- Input: student history, assignment difficulty, time remaining
- Output: completion probability, recommended start date
- Algorithm: Historical completion rate + time management score

**At-Risk Detection:**
- Input: engagement score, accuracy trend, practice frequency
- Output: risk level (low, medium, high), risk factors
- Algorithm: Multi-factor scoring with thresholds

**Performance Forecast:**
- Input: historical performance data
- Output: projected accuracy for next 7/30 days
- Algorithm: Moving average with trend adjustment

## Step 9.3: Personalized Recommendations

### Goals
- Recommend next skills to practice
- Suggest optimal practice times
- Recommend study strategies
- Identify prerequisite gaps

### Features

**Skill Recommendations:**
- Based on: mastered skills, current accuracy, learning path
- Output: Top 5 recommended skills with reasons
- Algorithm: Prerequisite tree + difficulty matching + interest

**Practice Time Recommendations:**
- Based on: historical session times, accuracy by time-of-day
- Output: Best times to practice, optimal session length
- Algorithm: Time-of-day performance analysis

**Study Strategy Recommendations:**
- Based on: learning patterns, struggle areas
- Output: Personalized tips (e.g., "Practice in shorter sessions")
- Algorithm: Pattern matching against successful students

**Gap Analysis:**
- Based on: skill dependencies, current mastery
- Output: Missing prerequisite skills
- Algorithm: Dependency graph traversal

## Step 9.4: Comparative Analytics (Enhanced)

### Goals
- Compare across multiple dimensions
- Benchmark against top performers
- Track improvement over time
- Identify outliers

### Features

**Multi-Dimensional Comparisons:**
- Student vs class vs grade vs platform average
- Current period vs previous period
- Actual vs expected performance

**Percentile Rankings:**
- Accuracy percentile
- Engagement percentile
- Learning velocity percentile

**Improvement Tracking:**
- Week-over-week changes
- Month-over-month changes
- Trend direction (improving/stable/declining)

## Step 9.5: Export & Reporting Tools

### Goals
- Export analytics data
- Generate printable reports
- Schedule automated reports
- Support multiple formats

### Features

**Export Formats:**
- JSON (raw data)
- CSV (spreadsheet-friendly)
- PDF (printable reports - future)

**Report Types:**
- Student progress report
- Class performance report
- Comparative analytics report
- Custom date range reports

**Scheduled Reports:**
- Weekly summary emails
- Monthly progress reports
- Alert notifications

## Technical Design

### Predictive Service

**PredictiveAnalyticsService:**
- `predict_skill_mastery(student_id, skill_id)` - Mastery prediction
- `predict_assignment_completion(student_id, assignment_id)` - Completion probability
- `detect_at_risk_students(class_id)` - Risk assessment
- `forecast_performance(student_id, days)` - Performance forecast

### Recommendation Service

**RecommendationService:**
- `get_skill_recommendations(student_id, count=5)` - Next skills
- `get_practice_time_recommendations(student_id)` - Optimal times
- `get_study_strategies(student_id)` - Personalized tips
- `analyze_skill_gaps(student_id)` - Missing prerequisites

### Export Service

**ExportService:**
- `export_student_data(student_id, format)` - Student data export
- `export_class_data(class_id, format)` - Class data export
- `generate_report(type, entity_id, format)` - Report generation
- `schedule_report(type, entity_id, frequency)` - Scheduled reports

## Implementation Plan

1. Create PredictiveAnalyticsService with prediction algorithms
2. Create RecommendationService with recommendation logic
3. Create ExportService with data export capabilities
4. Create API routes for all three services
5. Test all features comprehensively

## Success Metrics

- 70% prediction accuracy for skill mastery
- 80% accuracy for at-risk detection
- 90% of recommendations are relevant
- 60% of teachers use export features
- 50% of students follow recommendations

**Implementation Approach:** Streamlined implementation focusing on core algorithms and API functionality.
