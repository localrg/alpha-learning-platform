**Tests:** Included in 18-test suite âœ…

### Step 9.3: Personalized Recommendations âœ…

**Implementation:**
- Skill recommendations (next skills to practice)
- Practice time recommendations (optimal scheduling)
- Study strategy recommendations (personalized tips)
- Skill gap analysis (missing prerequisites)

**Recommendation Logic:**
1. **Skills:** Prioritizes struggling skills â†’ near-mastery skills â†’ new challenges
2. **Practice Time:** Analyzes time-of-day performance to find optimal windows
3. **Study Strategies:** Pattern-matches against successful learning behaviors
4. **Gaps:** Identifies missing foundational skills from earlier grades

**API Endpoints:** 4
- Skill recommendations with reasons and priorities
- Practice time recommendations with best time/duration/frequency
- Study strategies with actionable tips
- Gap analysis with prerequisite identification

**Tests:** Included in 18-test suite âœ…

### Step 9.4: Comparative Analytics (Enhanced) âœ…

**Implementation:**
- Multi-dimensional comparisons (accuracy, time, skills, engagement)
- Student vs class average
- Student vs grade-level average
- Percentile rankings and improvement tracking

**Note:** This step was integrated into Step 9.1 (Analytics Dashboard) as the comparative analytics functionality was already implemented there.

**Tests:** Covered in Step 9.1 tests âœ…

### Step 9.5: Export & Reporting Tools âœ…

**Implementation:**
- Student data export (JSON, CSV)
- Class data export (JSON, CSV)
- Report generation (student progress, class performance, comparative)
- Flexible format support with proper headers

**Export Formats:**
- **JSON:** Complete nested structure for programmatic access
- **CSV:** Flattened summary format for spreadsheet analysis
- **Streaming:** Efficient handling of large datasets
- **Headers:** Proper Content-Disposition for downloads

**API Endpoints:** 3
- Student data export with format parameter
- Class data export with format parameter
- Report generation with type and format parameters

**Tests:** Included in 18-test suite âœ…
