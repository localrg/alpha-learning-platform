## Business Logic

### Student Performance Report Generation

```python
def get_student_performance_report(student_id, days=30):
    # Get sessions in date range
    sessions = get_sessions(student_id, last_N_days=days)
    
    # Calculate overall metrics
    total_questions = sum(s.questions_answered for s in sessions)
    total_correct = sum(s.questions_correct for s in sessions)
    avg_accuracy = total_correct / total_questions
    
    # Get skill breakdown
    paths = get_learning_paths(student_id)
    skill_breakdown = []
    for path in paths:
        skill_breakdown.append({
            'skill': path.skill.name,
            'accuracy': path.current_accuracy,
            'mastery': 'mastered' if path.mastery_achieved else 'in_progress',
            'questions': path.questions_answered
        })
    
    # Get trend data
    trends = get_trend_data(student_id, 'accuracy', days)
    
    # Get class comparison
    comparison = get_student_comparison(student_id)
    
    return {
        'overall': {...},
        'skills': skill_breakdown,
        'trends': trends,
        'comparison': comparison
    }
```

### Targeted Assignment Creation

```python
def create_targeted_assignment(teacher_id, student_id, auto_fill=True):
    if auto_fill:
        # Get struggling skills (accuracy < 70%)
        paths = get_learning_paths(student_id)
        struggling = [p for p in paths if p.current_accuracy < 0.7]
        struggling.sort(key=lambda p: p.current_accuracy)  # Worst first
        
        # Take top 3
        skills = struggling[:3]
        skill_ids = [s.skill_id for s in skills]
        
        # Determine difficulty
        avg_accuracy = sum(s.current_accuracy for s in skills) / len(skills)
        if avg_accuracy < 0.5:
            difficulty = 'easy'
        elif avg_accuracy < 0.65:
            difficulty = 'medium'
        else:
            difficulty = 'adaptive'
        
        # Create assignment
        assignment = create_assignment(
            teacher_id=teacher_id,
            student_ids=[student_id],
            skill_ids=skill_ids,
            question_count=15,
            difficulty=difficulty,
            due_date=now() + 3_days
        )
        
        # Record intervention
        record_intervention(
            teacher_id=teacher_id,
            student_id=student_id,
            type='assignment',
            action=f'Created targeted assignment: {assignment.title}'
        )
        
        return assignment
```

### Message Template Filling

```python
def fill_template(template_id, variables):
    template = get_template(template_id)
    message = template.content
    
    # Replace variables
    for key, value in variables.items():
        placeholder = '{' + key + '}'
        message = message.replace(placeholder, str(value))
    
    return message

# Example:
template = "Hi {student_name}, I noticed you're struggling with {skill_name}."
variables = {'student_name': 'Student 3', 'skill_name': 'Fractions'}
result = "Hi Student 3, I noticed you're struggling with Fractions."
```
