**Test Results:** 12/12 tests passed ✅

## Overview

Step 8.3 successfully implements comprehensive activity reports for parents, providing detailed insights into their child's learning patterns, progress trends, and performance analytics over time. The system generates four types of reports with automated insights and supports multiple time periods.

## Implementation Summary

### Backend Components

#### 1. ReportService (`backend/src/services/report_service.py`)
Comprehensive service with 10 methods for report generation:

**Core Methods:**
- `generate_weekly_report(parent_id, student_id, week_offset)` - Weekly progress summary
- `generate_monthly_report(parent_id, student_id, month_offset)` - Monthly comprehensive report
- `generate_skill_report(parent_id, student_id)` - Skill-level performance analysis
- `generate_time_analysis(parent_id, student_id, days)` - Practice pattern analysis

**Helper Methods:**
- `verify_parent_child_link()` - Authorization verification
- `_get_date_range()` - Period calculation for week/month/custom
- `_calculate_trends()` - Trend detection and percentage changes

**Features:**
- Automated insights generation
- Trend analysis (improving/stable/declining)
- Consistency scoring
- Comparison to previous periods
- Day-by-day and week-by-week breakdowns
- Skill categorization and time distribution

#### 2. API Routes (`backend/src/routes/report_routes.py`)
4 endpoints for report access:

- `GET /api/parent/children/<id>/reports/weekly` - Weekly report
  - Query params: `parent_id`, `week_offset` (default: 0)
- `GET /api/parent/children/<id>/reports/monthly` - Monthly report
  - Query params: `parent_id`, `month_offset` (default: 0)
- `GET /api/parent/children/<id>/reports/skills` - Skill performance
