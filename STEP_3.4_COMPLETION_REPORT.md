## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Backend Changes**

**1. Learning Path Service**
```python
@staticmethod
def check_and_update_mastery(learning_path_id):
    item = LearningPath.query.get(learning_path_id)
    
    # Check criteria
    is_mastered = (
        item.current_accuracy >= 90.0 and
        item.questions_answered >= 5
    )
    
    # Update if newly mastered
    if is_mastered and not item.mastery_achieved:
        item.mastery_achieved = True
        item.mastery_date = datetime.utcnow()
        item.status = 'mastered'
        db.session.commit()
        return {'newly_mastered': True, ...}
```

**2. API Endpoint Update**
```python
@bp.route('/update-progress', methods=['PUT'])
def update_progress():
    # ... update progress ...
    
    # Check for mastery
    mastery_status = LearningPathService.check_and_update_mastery(
        learning_path_item.id
    )
    
    return jsonify({
        'learning_path_item': item.to_dict(),
        'mastery_status': mastery_status
    })
```

### **Frontend Changes**

**1. SkillPractice Component**
```javascript
// New state
const [masteryAchieved, setMasteryAchieved] = useState(false);
const [masteryData, setMasteryData] = useState(null);

// Check mastery in completePractice
const response = await axios.put('/api/learning-path/update-progress', ...);

if (response.data.mastery_status?.newly_mastered) {
  setMasteryAchieved(true);
  setMasteryData(response.data.mastery_status);
} else {
  setPracticeComplete(true);
}

// Render mastery screen
if (masteryAchieved && masteryData) {
  return <MasteryAchievement skill={masteryData} ... />;
}
```

**2. MasteryAchievement Component**
- Full-screen celebration
- Animated elements
