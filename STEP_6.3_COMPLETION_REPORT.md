## ‚úÖ Status: COMPLETE

**Completion Date:** December 2024  
**Step:** 6.3 of 60 (27/60 = 45.0% overall progress)  
**Week:** 6 of 12 (Week 6: 60% complete)

## Summary

Successfully implemented a complete class groups system that enables teachers to organize students into classes and allows students to collaborate through group leaderboards, shared progress tracking, and class-based activities.

---

## What Was Built

### Backend Class System

**Database Models:**
- **ClassGroup Model** - Class entity with name, description, teacher, grade level, invite code
- **ClassMembership Model** - Bidirectional membership linking students to classes

**ClassService (13 Methods):**
1. `generate_invite_code()` - Generate unique 6-character codes
2. `create_class()` - Create new class (teacher)
3. `get_class()` - Get class by ID
4. `update_class()` - Update class details (teacher only)
5. `delete_class()` - Delete class (teacher only)
6. `join_class()` - Join via invite code
7. `leave_class()` - Leave class voluntarily
8. `remove_member()` - Remove member (teacher only)
9. `get_student_classes()` - Get all classes for student
10. `get_class_members()` - Get all members with stats
11. `get_class_leaderboard()` - Get ranked member list
12. `get_class_stats()` - Get aggregate statistics

**API Endpoints (11):**
- `POST /api/classes` - Create class
- `GET /api/classes` - Get my classes
- `GET /api/classes/<id>` - Get class details
- `PUT /api/classes/<id>` - Update class
- `DELETE /api/classes/<id>` - Delete class
- `POST /api/classes/join` - Join via invite code
- `DELETE /api/classes/<id>/leave` - Leave class
- `DELETE /api/classes/<id>/members/<id>` - Remove member
- `GET /api/classes/<id>/members` - Get members
- `GET /api/classes/<id>/leaderboard` - Get leaderboard
- `GET /api/classes/<id>/stats` - Get statistics

### Frontend Class Interface

**ClassesPage Component:**
- **Three-Tab Design** - My Classes | Join Class | Create Class
- **Class Cards** - Grid layout with name, description, grade, member count
- **Join Form** - Enter 6-character invite code
- **Create Form** - Name, description, grade level selector
- **Class Detail View** - Full class page with leaderboard and stats

**Class Detail Features:**
- **Header** - Class name, description, metadata, invite code (teacher)
- **Stats Summary** - 3-card grid (members, total XP, average level)
- **Leaderboard** - Ranked member list with avatars, levels, XP
- **Top 3 Styling** - Gold/silver/bronze backgrounds for podium
- **Leave Button** - Students can leave voluntarily

### Business Logic

**Invite Code System:**
- 6-character alphanumeric codes (e.g., "WVSDCZ")
- Unique across all classes
- Case-insensitive entry
- Automatic generation on class creation

**Membership Rules:**
- Students can join multiple classes
- Teachers own their classes (creator = owner)
- Only teachers can remove members
- Students can leave voluntarily (except teachers from own class)
- Class deletion removes all memberships

**Privacy & Permissions:**
- Only class members can view class details
- Teacher sees invite code, students don't
- Leaderboard respects profile privacy settings
- Member stats use public profile data

2. ‚úÖ Create class with invite code
3. ‚úÖ Students join class via invite code
4. ‚úÖ Get class members (2 members found)
5. ‚úÖ Get class leaderboard (ranked by XP)
6. ‚úÖ Get class statistics (member count, XP, levels)
7. ‚úÖ Get student's classes (1 class found)
8. ‚úÖ Student leaves class (1 member remaining)
9. ‚úÖ Teacher removes member (0 members remaining)
10. ‚úÖ Delete class (class removed from database)
11. ‚úÖ Cleanup test data

## Integration Points

**With Profile System (6.1):**
- Member cards show profile avatars
- Privacy settings respected in leaderboard
- Profile visibility controls what classmates see

**With Friend System (6.2):**
- Classmates can send friend requests
- Friend status could be shown on member cards (future)

**With Gamification (5.1-5.3):**
- Class leaderboard uses XP and levels
- Class stats aggregate member progress
- Foundation for class-wide achievements

**Foundation for Future Steps:**
- **Shared Challenges (6.4):** Class-wide challenges
- **Social Feed (6.5):** Class activity feed

## Technical Notes

### Invite Code Generation
```python
import random
import string

def generate_invite_code():
    """Generate unique 6-character code."""
    while True:
        code = ''.join(random.choices(
            string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits,
            k=6
        ))
        if not ClassGroup.query.filter_by(invite_code=code).first():
            return code
```

### Class Leaderboard Query
```python
# Get all members with their progress, sorted by XP
members = ClassService.get_class_members(class_id)
members.sort(key=lambda x: x['xp'], reverse=True)

# Add rank
for i, member in enumerate(members, 1):
    member['rank'] = i
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE class_groups (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    teacher_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    grade_level INTEGER NOT NULL,
    invite_code VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE class_memberships (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    class_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES class_groups(id),
    student_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES students(id),
    role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'student',
    joined_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(class_id, student_id)
);
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Invite codes work better than email invites** - Simple, shareable, no email required
2. **Bidirectional membership** - Single record per student-class pair simplifies queries
3. **Teacher ownership model** - Creator is permanent owner, can't be removed
4. **Aggregate stats are powerful** - Class-level metrics motivate group effort
5. **Leaderboard privacy** - Respect individual privacy settings even in group context

---

## Production Readiness
