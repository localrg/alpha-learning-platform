## Technical Achievements

### 1. Flexible Configuration System

Examples use JSON configuration for maximum flexibility:

**Number Line Example:**
```json
{
  "min": 0,
  "max": 20,
  "start_value": 5,
  "operation": "add",
  "operand": 3,
  "show_jumps": true,
  "show_labels": true,
  "instructions": "Show 5 + 3 on the number line"
}
```

**Array Grid Example:**
```json
{
  "rows": 3,
  "cols": 4,
  "editable": true,
  "show_equation": true,
  "allow_resize": true,
  "instructions": "Build a 3 Ã— 4 array"
}
```

### 2. Comprehensive Interaction Logging

All student actions are logged with timestamps:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "drag_marker",
    "from": 5,
    "to": 8,
    "timestamp": "2025-10-17T11:22:43.123456"
  },
  {
    "action": "show_animation",
    "operation": "add",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-17T11:22:45.654321"
  }
]
```

### 3. Smart Recommendations

Recommends examples based on:
- Student's current learning path
- Uncompleted examples for upcoming skills
- Difficulty progression
- Sequence order

### 4. Real-time Analytics

Tracks engagement metrics:
- Total examples tried

## Learning Science Foundation

### Constructivism

Interactive examples embody constructivist principles by allowing students to build knowledge through active manipulation and discovery, rather than passive reception.

### Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) Progression

Examples provide the **pictorial** bridge between concrete manipulatives and abstract symbols, supporting the research-backed CPA approach to mathematics learning.

### Embodied Cognition

Physical interaction (dragging, clicking) creates embodied understanding, linking motor actions with mathematical concepts and strengthening neural pathways.

### Immediate Feedback

Real-time visual feedback enables rapid hypothesis testing and self-correction, accelerating learning and preventing misconception formation.

### Multiple Representations

Examples show concepts in multiple ways (visual, numeric, symbolic), supporting deeper understanding and transfer to new contexts.

### Discovery Learning

Open-ended exploration allows students to discover patterns and relationships independently, promoting deeper engagement and retention.
