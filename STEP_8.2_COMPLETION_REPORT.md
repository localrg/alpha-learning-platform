- Comprehensive metrics calculation
- Activity aggregation from multiple sources
- Proper error handling

#### 2. API Routes (`src/routes/parent_view_routes.py`)
RESTful endpoints for parent access:

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/parent/children/<id>/overview` - Child summary
- `GET /api/parent/children/<id>/skills` - Skills list (with ?status filter)
- `GET /api/parent/children/<id>/activity` - Activity feed (with ?days filter)
- `GET /api/parent/children/<id>/assignments` - Assignments (with ?status filter)
- `GET /api/parent/children/<id>/achievements` - Achievements

**Features:**
- Query parameter support for filtering
