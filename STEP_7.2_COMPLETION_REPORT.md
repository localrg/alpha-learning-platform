## Business Logic

### Assignment Creation Validation

```python
# Validate required fields
if not data.get('title'):
    return {'error': 'Title is required'}, 400

if not data.get('skill_ids') or not isinstance(data['skill_ids'], list):
    return {'error': 'At least one skill is required'}, 400

question_count = data.get('question_count', 10)
if question_count < 5 or question_count > 50:
    return {'error': 'Question count must be between 5 and 50'}, 400

# Verify teacher owns class
if class_id:
    class_group = ClassGroup.query.get(class_id)
    if not class_group or class_group.teacher_id != teacher_id:
        return {'error': 'Class not found or unauthorized'}, 403
```

### XP Calculation

```python
def _calculate_xp(assignment, assignment_student):
    """Calculate XP earned for assignment completion"""
    # Base XP: 10 per question
    base_xp = assignment.question_count * 10
    
    # Accuracy bonus
    accuracy = assignment_student.accuracy
    if accuracy >= 0.9:
        accuracy_bonus = base_xp * 0.5
    elif accuracy >= 0.8:
        accuracy_bonus = base_xp * 0.25
    elif accuracy >= 0.7:
        accuracy_bonus = base_xp * 0.1
    else:
        accuracy_bonus = 0
    
    # On-time bonus
    on_time_bonus = 0
    if assignment.due_date and assignment_student.completed_at:
        if assignment_student.completed_at <= assignment.due_date:
            on_time_bonus = base_xp * 0.2
    
    total_xp = int(base_xp + accuracy_bonus + on_time_bonus)
    return total_xp
```

### Update Restrictions

```python
# Check if any student has started
started = any(sa.status != 'assigned' for sa in assignment.student_assignments)

# Can always update title, description, due date
if 'title' in data:
    assignment.title = data['title']

# Cannot update skills, questions, difficulty after students start
if started:
    if 'skill_ids' in data or 'question_count' in data or 'difficulty' in data:
        return {'error': 'Cannot change assignment details after students have started'}, 400
```
