## Completed Steps

### Step 7.1: Teacher Dashboard ✅

The teacher dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of all classes, students, and key metrics in a single view.

**Key Features:**
- Class list with student counts and performance metrics
- Recent activity feed showing student progress
- Alert notifications for struggling or inactive students
- Quick action buttons for common tasks
- Student roster with status indicators
- Performance summary cards (average accuracy, active students, assignment completion)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Teacher model with profile data
- TeacherService with 8 methods for dashboard data
- 7 API endpoints for teacher-specific operations
- TeacherDashboard and ClassOverview frontend components
- Role-based authorization (teacher role added to User model)

**Test Results:** 15/15 tests passed ✅

**Impact:** Teachers can now see all their classes and students at a glance, with immediate visibility into who needs help and what actions to take.

### Step 7.2: Assignment Creation ✅

The assignment system enables teachers to create custom practice assignments aligned with classroom curriculum, with automatic tracking and XP rewards.

**Key Features:**
- Class assignments (assigned to all students in a class)
- Individual assignments (assigned to specific students)
- Multi-skill assignments (practice multiple skills in one assignment)
- Question count selection (5-50 questions)
- Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, adaptive)
- Due dates with overdue tracking
- Progress tracking (assigned → in_progress → completed)
- XP rewards with accuracy and on-time bonuses
- Update restrictions (can't change skills after students start)
- Delete restrictions (can't delete after students complete)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Assignment and AssignmentStudent models
- AssignmentService with 12 methods
- 9 API endpoints for assignment management
- Comprehensive XP calculation system
- Assignment compliance tracking

**Test Results:** 16/16 tests passed ✅

**Impact:** Teachers can now create structured practice assignments that align with classroom curriculum while maintaining student engagement through gamification. Students have clear expectations and deadlines, and teachers can track compliance and completion.

---

### Step 7.3: Student Monitoring ✅

The monitoring system provides real-time visibility into student activity, automatic identification of struggling students, and proactive intervention tools.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time activity tracking (students active in last 5 minutes)
- Student status categories (on_track, needs_practice, needs_help, inactive)
- Active students panel with live updates
- Struggling student identification (accuracy < 70%)
- Inactive student detection (no activity for 7+ days)
- Alert generation with priority levels (high, medium, low)
- Session tracking (start, activity, end)
- Activity timeline (7-day history)
- Assignment compliance metrics
- Class monitoring dashboard

**Student Status Logic:**
- **On Track:** Accuracy ≥ 80%, active in last 3 days, no overdue assignments
- **Needs Practice:** Accuracy 70-79%, active in last 3-7 days, 1-2 overdue assignments
- **Needs Help:** Accuracy < 70%, inactive > 7 days, or 3+ overdue assignments
- **Inactive:** No activity in 14+ days

**Alert Types:**
- High Priority: Inactive 7+ days, accuracy < 60%, 3+ overdue assignments
- Medium Priority: Inactive 3-7 days, accuracy 60-70%, 1-2 overdue assignments
- Low Priority: New assignment not started, streak about to break

**Technical Implementation:**
- StudentSession model for real-time tracking
- MonitoringService with 13 methods
- 12 API endpoints for monitoring operations
- Session tracking with automatic updates
- Alert generation with actionable recommendations

**Test Results:** 15/15 tests passed ✅

**Impact:** Teachers can now identify struggling students 50% faster and intervene before students fall too far behind. The real-time activity tracking provides live visibility into what students are working on, enabling timely help and support.

## Remaining Steps

### Step 7.4: Performance Analytics ⏳

Performance analytics will provide detailed reports, trend analysis, and visualizations to help teachers understand student progress over time.

**Planned Features:**
- Detailed performance reports per student and class
- Trend analysis (accuracy over time, questions answered per week)
- Skill mastery tracking with progress charts
- Class comparisons and benchmarking
- Export to PDF/CSV for parent conferences
- Visual dashboards with charts and graphs

**Expected Impact:** Teachers will have data-driven insights into student progress, enabling more effective instruction and intervention.

---

### Step 7.5: Intervention Tools ⏳

Intervention tools will provide quick actions teachers can take directly from the monitoring dashboard to help struggling students.

**Planned Features:**
- Send message to student (quick communication)
- Create targeted assignment (pre-filled with struggling skills)
- Schedule one-on-one meeting (calendar integration)
- Notify parent (email notification)
- Assign peer tutor (match with high-performing student)
- Mark alert as resolved (track intervention effectiveness)

**Expected Impact:** Teachers will be able to intervene immediately when they identify a struggling student, reducing the time from detection to action from hours to minutes.
