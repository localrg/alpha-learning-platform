### State Management
```javascript
- loading: boolean
- skill: object
- questions: array
- currentQuestionIndex: number
- selectedAnswer: string
- feedback: object | null
- showHint: boolean
- sessionStats: { correct, total, startTime }
- practiceComplete: boolean
- learningPathItem: object | null
```

### API Integration
**Endpoints Used:**
1. `GET /api/assessment/skills?skill_id={id}` - Get skill and questions
2. `GET /api/learning-path/current` - Get learning path item
3. `PUT /api/learning-path/update-progress` - Update progress

### Progress Update Logic
```javascript
// After each question
sessionStats.correct += isCorrect ? 1 : 0
sessionStats.total += 1

// On completion
accuracy = (correct / total) * 100
await updateProgress(skillId, correct, total)
```
