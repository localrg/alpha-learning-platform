# Step 7.3: Student Monitoring - Design Document

## Overview

Provide teachers with real-time monitoring tools to track student activity, identify struggling students, and intervene when needed. This system enables proactive teaching by alerting teachers to students who need help before they fall too far behind.

---

## Goals

1. **Real-time activity monitoring** - See what students are working on now
2. **Identify struggling students** - Automatic detection based on performance
3. **Track inactive students** - Alert when students haven't practiced recently
4. **Provide intervention tools** - Quick actions to help students
5. **Monitor assignment completion** - Track who's completing assignments on time

---

## Core Features

### Real-Time Activity Dashboard

Teachers can see:
- **Active Students** - Students currently practicing (last 5 minutes)
- **What They're Working On** - Current skill, question number, accuracy

- Active in last 7 days
- Some assignments incomplete
- Status: Yellow indicator

**Needs Help:**
- Accuracy < 70%
- Inactive > 7 days
- Multiple assignments overdue
- Status: Red indicator

**Inactive:**
- No activity in 14+ days
- Status: Gray indicator

### Monitoring Metrics

**Per Student:**
- Last active timestamp
- Current session duration
- Questions answered today/week
- Current accuracy
- Struggling skills (< 70%)
- Assignment completion rate

## Business Logic

### Status Determination

```python
def get_student_status(student_id):
    # Get metrics
    accuracy = get_avg_accuracy(student_id)
    last_active = get_last_active(student_id)
    days_inactive = (datetime.utcnow() - last_active).days
    overdue_assignments = get_overdue_assignments(student_id)
    
    # Determine status
    if days_inactive > 14:
        return 'inactive'
    elif accuracy < 0.7 or days_inactive > 7 or len(overdue_assignments) >= 3:
        return 'needs_help'
    elif accuracy < 0.8 or days_inactive > 3 or len(overdue_assignments) > 0:
        return 'needs_practice'
    else:
        return 'on_track'
```

### Alert Generation

```python
def generate_alerts(class_id):
    alerts = []
    students = get_class_students(class_id)
    
    for student in students:
        # Inactivity alerts
        days_inactive = get_days_inactive(student.id)
        if days_inactive >= 7:
            alerts.append({
                'severity': 'high',
                'type': 'inactive',
                'student_id': student.id,
                'message': f'{student.name} inactive for {days_inactive} days',
                'action': 'Send reminder'
            })
        
        # Performance alerts
        accuracy = get_avg_accuracy(student.id)
        if accuracy < 0.6:
            alerts.append({
                'severity': 'high',
                'type': 'low_performance',
                'student_id': student.id,
                'message': f'{student.name} accuracy dropped to {accuracy:.0%}',
                'action': 'Create targeted assignment'
            })
        
        # Assignment alerts
        overdue = get_overdue_assignments(student.id)
        if len(overdue) >= 3:
            alerts.append({
                'severity': 'high',
                'type': 'overdue_assignments',
                'student_id': student.id,
                'message': f'{student.name} has {len(overdue)} overdue assignments',
                'action': 'Message student'
            })
    
    # Sort by severity
    priority_order = {'high': 0, 'medium': 1, 'low': 2}
    alerts.sort(key=lambda x: priority_order[x['severity']])
    
    return alerts
```

### Session Tracking

```python
def track_session_activity(student_id, skill_id, question_id, correct):
    # Get or create active session
    session = StudentSession.query.filter_by(
        student_id=student_id,
        is_active=True
    ).first()
    
    if not session:
        session = StudentSession(
            student_id=student_id,
            skill_id=skill_id
        )
        db.session.add(session)
    
    # Update session
    session.questions_answered += 1
    if correct:
        session.questions_correct += 1
    session.accuracy = session.questions_correct / session.questions_answered
    session.last_activity_at = datetime.utcnow()
    
    db.session.commit()
    return session
```
