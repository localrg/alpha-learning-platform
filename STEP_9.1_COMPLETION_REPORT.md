## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Metrics
The dashboard provides a complete picture of learning activity with 9 key metrics that cover time investment, performance, progress, and engagement.

### 2. Trend Analysis
Daily aggregates enable visualization of practice patterns, accuracy trends, and activity levels over time, helping identify improvements or declines.

### 3. Comparative Analytics
Students can see how they compare to classmates or grade-level peers, providing context and motivation. Teachers can identify students who need support.

### 4. Engagement Scoring
The composite engagement score combines multiple factors into a single, easy-to-understand metric that predicts student retention and success.

### 5. Status Categorization
Automatic categorization of students (on_track, needs_practice, struggling) enables teachers to quickly identify who needs attention.

### 6. Subject Distribution
Understanding which subjects students practice most helps identify interests and gaps in coverage.
