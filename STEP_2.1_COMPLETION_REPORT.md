## Models Implemented

### 1. Skill Model

**Purpose:** Represents a math skill that students need to master

**Fields:**
- `id` - Primary key
- `name` - Skill name (e.g., "Basic Multiplication")
- `description` - Detailed description
- `grade_level` - Target grade (3-8)
- `subject_area` - Category (arithmetic, fractions, geometry, etc.)
- `prerequisite_skill_ids` - JSON array of prerequisite skill IDs
- `mastery_threshold` - Required accuracy (default 0.9 = 90%)
- `created_at` - Timestamp

**Relationships:**
- Has many Questions

**Methods:**
- `to_dict()` - Convert to JSON

**Example:**
```python
skill = Skill(
    name="Basic Multiplication",
    description="Multiply single-digit numbers",
    grade_level=3,
    subject_area="arithmetic",
    mastery_threshold=0.9
)
```

---

### 2. Question Model

**Purpose:** Represents a question in the question bank

**Fields:**
- `id` - Primary key
- `skill_id` - Foreign key to Skill
- `question_text` - The question
- `question_type` - Type: multiple_choice, numeric, text
- `correct_answer` - The correct answer
- `options` - JSON array of options (for multiple choice)
- `explanation` - Explanation of the answer
- `difficulty` - easy, medium, hard
- `grade_level` - Target grade (3-8)
- `created_at` - Timestamp

**Relationships:**
- Belongs to Skill
- Has many AssessmentResponses

**Methods:**
- `to_dict(include_answer=False)` - Convert to JSON, optionally include answer

**Example:**
```python
question = Question(
    skill_id=1,
    question_text="What is 7 × 8?",
    question_type="multiple_choice",
    correct_answer="56",
    options=["42", "48", "56", "64"],
    explanation="7 × 8 = 56 because 7 added 8 times equals 56",
    difficulty="medium",
    grade_level=3
)
```

---

### 3. Assessment Model

**Purpose:** Represents an assessment taken by a student

**Fields:**
- `id` - Primary key
- `student_id` - Foreign key to Student
- `assessment_type` - Type: diagnostic, unit_test, skill_check
- `grade_level` - Grade level assessed
- `total_questions` - Number of questions
- `correct_answers` - Number correct
- `score_percentage` - Calculated score (0-100)
- `completed` - Boolean flag
- `started_at` - Start timestamp
- `completed_at` - Completion timestamp

**Relationships:**
- Belongs to Student
- Has many AssessmentResponses

**Methods:**
- `to_dict()` - Convert to JSON
- `calculate_score()` - Calculate and update score
- `mark_complete()` - Mark as completed and calculate final score

**Example:**
```python
assessment = Assessment(
    student_id=1,
    assessment_type="diagnostic",
    grade_level=5,
    total_questions=10
)
assessment.correct_answers = 8
assessment.mark_complete()  # Sets score to 80%
```

---

### 4. AssessmentResponse Model

**Purpose:** Represents a student's response to a single question

**Fields:**
- `id` - Primary key
- `assessment_id` - Foreign key to Assessment
- `question_id` - Foreign key to Question
- `student_answer` - Student's answer
- `is_correct` - Boolean flag
- `time_spent_seconds` - Time spent on question
- `answered_at` - Timestamp

**Relationships:**
- Belongs to Assessment
- Belongs to Question

**Methods:**
- `to_dict()` - Convert to JSON

**Example:**
```python
response = AssessmentResponse(
    assessment_id=1,
    question_id=5,
    student_answer="56",
    is_correct=True,
    time_spent_seconds=15
)
```
