- Export logs to CSV
- Real-time log streaming

**Retention:**

## Technical Design

### Admin Service

**AdminService:**
- `get_platform_metrics()` - Dashboard statistics
- `get_user_growth()` - Growth trends
- `get_system_health()` - Health metrics
- `get_recent_activity()` - Recent events

### User Management Service

**UserManagementService:**
- `create_user(data)` - Create new user
- `update_user(id, data)` - Update user
- `delete_user(id, options)` - Delete user
- `search_users(query, filters)` - Search/filter
- `bulk_import_users(csv_data)` - Bulk import
- `bulk_update_users(ids, updates)` - Bulk update

### Content Management Service

**ContentManagementService:**
- `create_skill(data)` - Create skill
- `update_skill(id, data)` - Update skill
- `delete_skill(id)` - Delete skill
- `bulk_import_skills(csv_data)` - Bulk import
- `create_question(data)` - Create question
- `update_question(id, data)` - Update question

### Settings Service

**SettingsService:**
- `get_settings(category)` - Get settings
- `update_setting(key, value)` - Update setting
- `get_feature_flags()` - Get feature flags
- `toggle_feature(flag, enabled)` - Toggle feature

### Audit Service

**AuditService:**
- `log_action(admin_id, action, entity, details)` - Log action
- `get_logs(filters)` - Retrieve logs
- `export_logs(filters, format)` - Export logs
- `get_admin_activity(admin_id)` - Admin's actions

## Database Models

### AuditLog
- id
- admin_id (foreign key to User)
- action_type (create, update, delete, login, etc.)
- entity_type (user, skill, question, setting)
- entity_id
- before_value (JSON)
- after_value (JSON)
- ip_address
- user_agent
- created_at

### SystemSetting
- id
- category (general, features, limits, integrations)
- key
- value (JSON for flexibility)
- description
- updated_by (admin_id)
- updated_at

## Implementation Approach

Given the comprehensive nature of Week 10 and our goal to complete the full 60-step program, I'll implement all 5 steps together in a streamlined manner:

1. Create database models (AuditLog, SystemSetting)
2. Create all 5 services (Admin, UserManagement, ContentManagement, Settings, Audit)
3. Create API routes for all services
4. Create comprehensive test suite
5. Document all features

This approach will efficiently complete Week 10 while maintaining quality and test coverage.

## Success Metrics

- Admins can view platform metrics in real-time
- User management reduces admin time by 50%
- Content management enables rapid curriculum updates
- Settings provide flexibility without code changes
- Audit logs ensure compliance and security

**Implementation:** Streamlined implementation of all 5 steps together for efficiency.
