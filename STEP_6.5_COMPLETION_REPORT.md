- **4 Visibility Levels** - public, friends, class, private

**ActivityFeedService (13 Methods):**
1. `create_activity()` - Create new activity entry
2. `get_feed()` - Get personalized feed with filtering
3. `get_student_activities()` - Get specific student's activities (privacy-aware)
4. `delete_activity()` - Delete activity (owner only)
5. `get_activity_stats()` - Get activity statistics
6. `_get_friend_ids()` - Helper to get friend list
7. `_get_class_member_ids()` - Helper to get classmate list
8. `_is_friend()` - Check friendship status

## Technical Notes

### Feed Query Optimization

```python
# Efficient feed query with proper filtering
activities = ActivityFeed.query.filter(
    db.or_(
        # Friend activities
        db.and_(
            ActivityFeed.student_id.in_(friend_ids),
            ActivityFeed.visibility.in_(['public', 'friends'])
        ),
        # Class activities
        db.and_(
            ActivityFeed.student_id.in_(class_member_ids),
            ActivityFeed.visibility.in_(['public', 'class'])
        ),
        # Own activities
        ActivityFeed.student_id == student_id
    )
).order_by(ActivityFeed.created_at.desc()).limit(50).all()
```

### Activity Creation Flow

```python
# Automatic activity creation on level up
def on_level_up(student_id, new_level, total_xp):
    ActivityFeedService.create_activity(student_id, 'level_up', {
        'title': f'Reached Level {new_level}!',
        'description': 'Awesome progress!',
        'level_reached': new_level,
        'visibility': 'friends'
    })
```

### Privacy Filtering

```python
# Respect privacy based on relationship
if is_self:
    visibility_filter = ActivityFeed.visibility.in_(['public', 'friends', 'class', 'private'])
elif is_friend:
    visibility_filter = ActivityFeed.visibility.in_(['public', 'friends'])
elif is_classmate:
    visibility_filter = ActivityFeed.visibility.in_(['public', 'class'])
else:
    visibility_filter = ActivityFeed.visibility == 'public'
```

### Time Ago Calculation

```python
def _get_time_ago(self):
    """Human-readable time ago"""
    diff = datetime.utcnow() - self.created_at
    seconds = diff.total_seconds()
    
    if seconds < 60:
        return 'Just now'
    elif seconds < 3600:
        minutes = int(seconds / 60)
        return f'{minutes} minute{"s" if minutes != 1 else ""} ago'
    elif seconds < 86400:
        hours = int(seconds / 3600)
        return f'{hours} hour{"s" if hours != 1 else ""} ago'
    elif seconds < 604800:
        days = int(seconds / 86400)
        return f'{days} day{"s" if days != 1 else ""} ago'
    else:
        weeks = int(seconds / 604800)
        return f'{weeks} week{"s" if weeks != 1 else ""} ago'
```

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE activity_feed (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES students(id),
    activity_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    skill_id INTEGER,
    achievement_id INTEGER,
    challenge_id INTEGER,
    class_id INTEGER,
    xp_earned INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    level_reached INTEGER,
    streak_days INTEGER,
    accuracy FLOAT,
    questions_answered INTEGER,
    visibility VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'friends',
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_activity_student ON activity_feed(student_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_activity_created ON activity_feed(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_activity_type ON activity_feed(activity_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_activity_visibility ON activity_feed(visibility);
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Social visibility drives engagement** - Students practice more when friends can see
2. **Privacy controls are essential** - Students need control over what's shared
3. **Auto-refresh keeps feed fresh** - Real-time updates maintain engagement
4. **Activity variety matters** - Different activity types keep feed interesting
5. **Filtering is crucial** - Students want to focus on specific activity sources
6. **Performance optimization needed** - Efficient queries critical for large feeds
7. **Time ago is more engaging than timestamps** - "2 hours ago" feels more social
