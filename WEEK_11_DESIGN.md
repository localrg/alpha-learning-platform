## Notes

This week focuses on polish and optimization rather than new features. The goal is to ensure the platform is production-ready with excellent performance, usability, and compatibility. Many optimizations can be implemented as configuration changes and best practices rather than extensive code changes.

The streamlined approach implements all 5 steps together, focusing on the most impactful optimizations that provide immediate value to users.
