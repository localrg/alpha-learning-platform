## Overview

The Resource Library provides a comprehensive collection of downloadable educational materials that students can use to support their learning outside the platform. This includes worksheets, reference guides, practice problems, study guides, and supplementary materials organized by skill, grade level, and resource type.

---

## Learning Science Foundation

### 1. Distributed Practice

Providing offline resources enables students to:
- Practice skills outside of screen time
- Reinforce learning through repeated exposure
- Distribute practice over time (more effective than massed practice)
- Engage in physical writing and problem-solving

### 2. Multimodal Learning

Different resource types support different learning preferences:
- **Visual learners:** Reference guides with diagrams and charts
- **Kinesthetic learners:** Hands-on worksheets and manipulatives
- **Reading/writing learners:** Study guides and written explanations
- **Auditory learners:** Printable materials for discussion

### 3. Parental Involvement

Downloadable resources enable:
- Parents to support learning at home
- Offline practice during travel or without internet
- Physical materials for tactile learners
- Homework and extra practice

### 4. Metacognitive Support

Reference materials help students:
- Self-monitor understanding
- Access information independently
- Build study skills
- Develop learning autonomy
