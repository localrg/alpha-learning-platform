## Learning Science Foundation

### 1. Self-Determination Theory

The gamification system supports the three psychological needs for intrinsic motivation:

**Autonomy:** Students choose what to practice and when, maintaining control over their learning journey.

**Competence:** Visible progress through XP and levels provides clear feedback on skill development and mastery.

**Relatedness:** Leaderboards and shared achievements create social connection and friendly competition.

### 2. Operant Conditioning

Positive reinforcement through immediate rewards:

**Immediate Feedback:** XP awarded instantly after each action, creating strong association between behavior and reward.

**Variable Rewards:** Bonus XP for streaks, perfect scores, and first-try correct answers creates excitement and unpredictability.

**Progressive Rewards:** Increasing XP requirements and better rewards at higher levels maintain long-term engagement.

### 3. Flow Theory

Optimal experience through balanced challenge:

**Clear Goals:** Points and levels provide concrete, measurable targets that guide student effort.

**Immediate Feedback:** Instant XP updates and progress bar changes show real-time advancement.

**Challenge-Skill Balance:** Difficulty multipliers ensure harder questions provide proportionally greater rewards.

### 4. Progress Principle

Celebrating small wins to maintain motivation:

**Visible Progress:** XP bars and level badges make abstract learning progress concrete and visible.

**Frequent Wins:** Multiple ways to earn XP ensure students experience regular success.

**Milestone Celebration:** Level-up animations and confetti create memorable moments of achievement.

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

**student_progress table:**
```sql
id                  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
student_id          INTEGER FOREIGN KEY (unique)
total_xp            INTEGER DEFAULT 0
current_level       INTEGER DEFAULT 1
xp_to_next_level    INTEGER DEFAULT 100
level_title         VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Novice'
xp_multiplier       FLOAT DEFAULT 1.0
created_at          DATETIME
updated_at          DATETIME
```

**xp_transactions table:**
```sql
id                  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
student_id          INTEGER FOREIGN KEY
action_type         VARCHAR(50)
base_xp             INTEGER
multiplier          FLOAT DEFAULT 1.0
bonus_xp            INTEGER DEFAULT 0
total_xp            INTEGER
description         VARCHAR(200)
extra_data          JSON
created_at          DATETIME
```

**level_rewards table:**
```sql
id                  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
level               INTEGER
reward_type         VARCHAR(50)  -- 'title', 'badge', 'avatar', 'multiplier'
reward_value        VARCHAR(100)
description         VARCHAR(200)
is_active           BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
```

**student_rewards table:**
```sql
id                  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
student_id          INTEGER FOREIGN KEY
reward_id           INTEGER FOREIGN KEY
unlocked_at         DATETIME
is_equipped         BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
```

### XP Calculation Algorithm

```python
def award_xp(student_id, action_type, base_xp, difficulty, metadata):
    # 1. Get base XP for action
    base = XP_VALUES[action_type]
    
    # 2. Apply student multiplier
    multiplier = student.xp_multiplier
    
    # 3. Apply difficulty multiplier
    if difficulty:
        multiplier *= DIFFICULTY_MULTIPLIERS[difficulty]
    
    # 4. Apply streak multiplier
    if metadata['streak'] >= 10:
        multiplier *= 2.0
    elif metadata['streak'] >= 5:
        multiplier *= 1.5
    elif metadata['streak'] >= 3:
        multiplier *= 1.2
    
    # 5. Calculate bonus XP
    bonus = 0
    if metadata['first_try']:
        bonus += 10
    if metadata['perfect']:
        bonus += 30
    
    # 6. Calculate total
    total_xp = (base * multiplier) + (bonus * multiplier)
    
    # 7. Update student progress
    student.total_xp += total_xp
    
    # 8. Check for level up
    while student.total_xp >= xp_for_next_level:
        student.level += 1
        unlock_rewards(student.level)
    
    return total_xp
```

### Level Progression Formula

```python
def calculate_xp_for_level(level):
    if level <= 1:
        return 0
    
    total_xp = 0
    for l in range(2, level + 1):
        total_xp += int(100 * (l ** 1.5))
    
    return total_xp
```

This creates exponential growth:
- Level 2: 282 XP (100 × 2^1.5)
- Level 3: 801 XP (282 + 100 × 3^1.5)
- Level 5: 2,719 XP
- Level 10: 19,316 XP
