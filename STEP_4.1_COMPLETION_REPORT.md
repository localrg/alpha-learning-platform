## Learning Science Foundation

The video tutorial system is grounded in established learning principles:

### Dual Coding Theory

Videos combine visual and auditory information, creating multiple memory pathways and improving retention compared to text-only instruction.

### Cognitive Load Management

Videos break complex concepts into digestible segments (2-8 minutes), preventing cognitive overload and maintaining attention.

### Worked Example Effect

Instructional videos provide step-by-step demonstrations, which research shows is more effective than problem-solving alone for novice learners.

### Self-Paced Learning

Students control playback (play, pause, rewatch), allowing them to learn at their own pace and revisit difficult concepts.

### Multimedia Principle

Combining words and pictures (as in videos) produces better learning than words alone, according to Mayer's research on multimedia learning.

---

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Metrics

- % of students watching videos before practice
- Average watch time per video
- Video completion rate
- Videos per skill practiced

### Learning Outcomes

- Correlation between video watching and mastery
- Time to mastery with vs without videos
- Student satisfaction ratings
- Practice accuracy after watching videos

### Content Quality

- Most popular videos
- Videos with highest completion
- Videos with most replays
- Videos needing improvement
