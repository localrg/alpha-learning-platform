## 1. Executive Summary

This report marks the successful completion of Week 5 of the frontend development for the Alpha Learning Platform. The primary focus of this week was to build out the remaining features of the Parent Portal, specifically focusing on communication, goal setting, and account management. All planned components were developed, integrated into the main application, and tested, ensuring the Parent Portal is now feature-complete according to the project plan.

## 2. Components Delivered

During this fifth week, a total of four new components were created for the Parent Portal, and the main application router was updated to include them. These components provide essential functionality for parents to manage their accounts and engage with their children's learning journey.

| Component              | File Path                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ParentMessaging.jsx`  | `frontend/src/components/parent/ParentMessaging.jsx`                   |
| `GoalManagement.jsx`   | `frontend/src/components/parent/GoalManagement.jsx`                    |
| `ChildLinking.jsx`     | `frontend/src/components/parent/ChildLinking.jsx`                      |
| `ParentSettings.jsx`   | `frontend/src/components/parent/ParentSettings.jsx`                    |

## 3. Key Features Implemented

The following key features were implemented as part of the Week 5 components:

- **Parent-Teacher Communication:** A real-time messaging interface (`ParentMessaging`) allows parents to communicate directly and securely with their children's teachers, view message history, and receive notifications for new messages.

- **Child Goal Setting:** The `GoalManagement` component provides a comprehensive interface for parents to set, track, and manage learning goals for their children. This includes setting goals for specific skills, time spent on the platform, or accuracy, and visualizing progress towards these goals.

- **Secure Child Account Linking:** The `ChildLinking` component implements a secure system for parents to link their accounts with their children's accounts. This can be done via a unique invite code generated by the student or by sending an email request that the student must approve.

- **Comprehensive Account Management:** The `ParentSettings` component offers a tabbed interface for parents to manage their profile information (name, phone number) and configure granular notification preferences for a wide range of platform events, such as progress updates, alerts, and messages.

## 4. API Integration and Routing

To support these new features, the frontend was integrated with several backend API endpoints. New API service modules (`communicationAPI` and `goalAPI`) were created in `frontend/src/services/api.js` to better organize the API calls related to messaging and goal management. The `AppRouter.jsx` file was updated to include routes for all the new Parent Portal components, ensuring they are correctly rendered within the `ParentLayout`.

## 5. Build and Test Status

- **Production Build:** The production build command (`npm run build`) completes successfully without any errors. Initial build failures related to incorrect API imports were identified and resolved.

- **Component Testing:** All new components have been manually tested to ensure they render correctly, handle user input as expected, and interact with the backend APIs successfully. The forms for linking children, updating profiles, and setting notification preferences are fully functional.

## 6. Next Steps

With the completion of Week 5, the Parent Portal is now fully functional. The next phase of the project will focus on the development of the Admin Panel, as outlined in the **Week 6** plan.
