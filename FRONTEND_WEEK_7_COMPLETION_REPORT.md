## 1. Executive Summary

This report marks the successful completion of Week 7 of the frontend development for the Alpha Learning Platform. The focus of this week was to expand the Admin Panel with critical features for content management, system settings, and audit logging. All planned components were developed, integrated, and tested, significantly enhancing the administrative control over the platform.

## 2. Components Delivered

During this seventh week, a total of five new components were created for the Admin Panel, providing administrators with the tools to manage the platform's content and configuration.

| Component                 | File Path                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ContentManagement.jsx`   | `frontend/src/components/admin/ContentManagement.jsx`                      |
| `SkillEditor.jsx`         | `frontend/src/components/admin/SkillEditor.jsx`                            |
| `SystemSettings.jsx`      | `frontend/src/components/admin/SystemSettings.jsx`                         |
| `AuditLogs.jsx`           | `frontend/src/components/admin/AuditLogs.jsx`                              |

## 3. Key Features Implemented

The following key features were implemented as part of the Week 7 components:

- **Comprehensive Content Management:** The `ContentManagement` component provides a full-featured interface for managing learning content. Administrators can now create, edit, and delete skills, with support for filtering by subject and grade level.

- **Detailed Skill Editor:** The `SkillEditor` component offers a detailed form for creating and editing skills, including fields for name, description, subject, grade level, difficulty, prerequisites, and learning objectives.

- **Dynamic System Settings:** The `SystemSettings` component provides a centralized location for administrators to configure platform-wide settings. The settings are organized by category, and the interface dynamically renders the appropriate input type for each setting.

- **Complete Audit Logging:** The `AuditLogs` component displays a detailed log of all administrative actions and system changes. The logs can be filtered by action type, entity type, and date range, and can be exported to a CSV file for offline analysis.

## 4. API Integration and Routing

The frontend was integrated with the backend admin API endpoints to manage content, settings, and audit logs. The `AppRouter.jsx` file was updated to include the new routes for the content management, system settings, and audit logs pages, all protected by an admin role check.

## 5. Build and Test Status

- **Production Build:** The production build command (`npm run build`) completes successfully without any errors, indicating that all new components and their dependencies are correctly configured.

- **Component Testing:** All new admin components have been manually tested. The content management system is fully functional, allowing for the creation, editing, and deletion of skills. The system settings can be updated and saved, and the audit logs are correctly displayed and filtered.

## 6. Next Steps

With the completion of Week 7, the Admin Panel is now equipped with a powerful set of tools for managing the platform. The next phase of development will focus on building out advanced analytics and polishing the user interface, as outlined in the **Week 8** plan.
