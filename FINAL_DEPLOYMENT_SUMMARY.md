## Creating Test Accounts

To test different user roles, you can register multiple accounts. By default, all new registrations are created as **student** accounts.

### Example Test Accounts You Can Create:

| Username | Email | Password | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| student1 | student1@example.com | password123 | Student |
| teacher1 | teacher1@example.com | password123 | Teacher* |
| parent1 | parent1@example.com | password123 | Parent* |
| admin1 | admin1@example.com | password123 | Admin* |

*Note: To create teacher, parent, or admin accounts, you would need to modify the user role in the database or add role selection to the registration form.*

## Known Limitations

1. **Database Persistence:** The database is stored in the deployment environment and will persist across restarts.

2. **Role Assignment:** Currently, all new registrations default to the "student" role. To test other roles, you would need to either:
   - Add a role selector to the registration form
   - Manually update user roles in the database
   - Create an admin interface for role management

3. **Initial Data:** The deployment starts with an empty database. You'll need to create your own test data by registering accounts and using the platform.

## Next Steps

1. **Register an account** and explore the student features
2. **Create sample data** by completing assessments and practice sessions
3. **Test the social features** by creating multiple student accounts
4. **Provide feedback** on any issues or improvements needed
