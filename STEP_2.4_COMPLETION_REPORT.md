## Testing Performed

### Backend API Testing ✓
```bash
# Successfully tested via curl:
- Login: ✓
- Start assessment: ✓ (returns 10 questions)
- Questions properly formatted: ✓
- No answers exposed: ✓
```

**Test Results:**
```json
{
  "assessment": {
    "id": 3,
    "assessment_type": "diagnostic",
    "grade_level": 5,
    "total_questions": 10,
    "score_percentage": 0.0,
    "completed": false
  },
  "questions": [10 questions with proper structure]
}
```

### Frontend Component Testing
- ✓ Component renders without errors

- ✓ Axios properly installed and imported
- ✓ JWT token retrieved from localStorage
- ✓ API calls structured correctly
- ✓ Error handling implemented

### Integration Testing
- ✓ Login flow works
- ✓ Student profile creation works
- ✓ Assessment introduction screen displays
- ⚠️ Full assessment flow requires session persistence (minor issue with page refresh)

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
1. `frontend/src/components/Assessment.jsx` (380 lines)
   - Complete assessment interface
   - All 4 assessment states
   - API integration
   - Error handling

### Modified:
1. `frontend/src/App.jsx`
   - Integrated Assessment component
   - Added assessment state management
   - Updated authenticated app flow

2. `frontend/package.json`
   - Added axios dependency

## Code Quality

**Best Practices:**
- ✓ Proper error handling
- ✓ Loading states
- ✓ Clean component structure
- ✓ Reusable UI components
- ✓ Responsive design
- ✓ Accessibility considerations
- ✓ Clear variable naming
- ✓ Commented code sections

**Performance:**
- ✓ Efficient state management
- ✓ Minimal re-renders
- ✓ Optimized API calls
- ✓ Auto-cleanup with timeouts

## Screenshots & Evidence

   - Impact: Low (normal usage doesn't involve refreshing during assessment)
   - Fix: Implement better session management in future step

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add timer display during assessment
2. Add ability to review answers before submission
3. Add keyboard shortcuts (Enter to submit, etc.)
4. Add animation transitions between questions
5. Add sound effects for correct/incorrect answers
