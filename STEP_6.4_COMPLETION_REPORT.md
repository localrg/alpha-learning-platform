## What Was Built

### Backend Challenge System

**Database Models:**
- **SharedChallenge Model** - Challenge entity with title, description, creator, type, mode, skill, targets, timing, status, rewards
- **ChallengeParticipant Model** - Participant tracking with invitation status, progress, completion, and ranking

**SharedChallengeService (12 Methods):**
1. `calculate_xp_reward()` - Calculate XP based on difficulty and targets
2. `create_challenge()` - Create friend or class challenge
3. `get_challenge()` - Get challenge details with participants
4. `get_student_challenges()` - Get all challenges for student (with filters)
5. `accept_challenge()` - Accept challenge invitation
6. `decline_challenge()` - Decline challenge invitation
7. `update_progress()` - Update progress after each question
8. `get_challenge_leaderboard()` - Get ranked participant list
9. `complete_challenge()` - Mark challenge complete and award bonuses
10. `delete_challenge()` - Delete challenge (creator only)
11. `expire_challenges()` - Background task to expire old challenges

**API Endpoints (9):**
- `POST /api/shared-challenges` - Create challenge
- `GET /api/shared-challenges` - Get my challenges (with status filter)
- `GET /api/shared-challenges/<id>` - Get challenge details
- `DELETE /api/shared-challenges/<id>` - Delete challenge
- `POST /api/shared-challenges/<id>/accept` - Accept invitation
- `POST /api/shared-challenges/<id>/decline` - Decline invitation
- `POST /api/shared-challenges/<id>/progress` - Update progress
- `GET /api/shared-challenges/<id>/leaderboard` - Get leaderboard
- `POST /api/shared-challenges/<id>/complete` - Complete challenge

### Frontend Challenge Interface

**SharedChallengesPage Component:**
- **Three-Tab Design** - Active | Invitations | Completed
- **Challenge Cards** - Display title, creator, type, mode, targets, time remaining
- **Progress Tracking** - Real-time progress bars and accuracy display
- **Rank Display** - Show current rank in competitive challenges
- **Action Buttons** - Accept/Decline, Continue, View Results
- **Create Challenge Modal** - Full-featured challenge creation form

**CreateChallengeModal Component:**
- **Challenge Details** - Title, description
- **Challenge Type** - Friend or Class selection
- **Challenge Mode** - Competitive or Collaborative
- **Skill Selection** - Choose skill to practice
- **Target Settings** - Questions (5-50), Accuracy (70-100%)
- **Duration Options** - 1hr, 6hr, 24hr, 3days, 1week
- **Participant Selection** - Friend picker or class selector
- **Validation** - Real-time form validation

**ChallengeDetailPage Component:**
- **Challenge Header** - Title, creator, description, badges

### Business Logic

**Challenge Types:**
- **Friend Challenge** - Created by any student, invite specific friends
- **Class Challenge** - Created by teachers only, auto-invites all class members

**Challenge Modes:**
- **Competitive** - Individual performance, ranked leaderboard, bonus XP for top 3
- **Collaborative** - Group achievement, all participants rewarded if goal met

**Progress Tracking:**
- Real-time question counting
- Automatic accuracy calculation
- Completion detection when targets met
- XP awarded immediately upon completion

**XP Reward System:**
```
Base XP: 50
Difficulty Multiplier: 1.5
Question Multiplier: target_questions / 10
Accuracy Multiplier: target_accuracy

Total XP = Base Ã— Difficulty Ã— Questions Ã— Accuracy
Minimum XP: 50

Competitive Bonuses:
- 1st place: +50% bonus XP
- 2nd place: +25% bonus XP
- 3rd place: +10% bonus XP
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Skill: Multiplication (difficulty 1.5)
- Target: 20 questions @ 90% accuracy
- Base XP: 50 Ã— 1.5 Ã— 2.0 Ã— 0.9 = **135 XP**
- Winner bonus: 135 + 67 = **202 XP**

## Technical Notes

### Challenge Creation Flow

```python
# 1. Validate creator and permissions
creator = Student.query.get(creator_id)

# 2. For class challenges, verify teacher role
if challenge_type == 'class':
    class_group = ClassGroup.query.get(class_id)
    if class_group.teacher_id != creator.user_id:
        return error('Only teachers can create class challenges')

# 3. Calculate XP reward
xp_reward = calculate_xp_reward(skill_id, target_questions, target_accuracy)

# 4. Create challenge
challenge = SharedChallenge(...)
db.session.add(challenge)
db.session.flush()

# 5. Add participants
for student_id in participant_ids:
    participant = ChallengeParticipant(
        challenge_id=challenge.id,
        student_id=student_id,
        status='invited'
    )
    db.session.add(participant)

# 6. Creator auto-accepts
creator_participant = ChallengeParticipant(
    challenge_id=challenge.id,
    student_id=creator_id,
    status='accepted'
)
db.session.add(creator_participant)

db.session.commit()
```

### Progress Update Flow

```python
# 1. Update question counts
participant.questions_answered += 1
if correct:
    participant.questions_correct += 1

# 2. Recalculate accuracy
participant.accuracy = participant.questions_correct / participant.questions_answered

# 3. Check completion
if (participant.questions_answered >= challenge.target_questions and
    participant.accuracy >= challenge.target_accuracy):
    participant.completed = True
    participant.completed_at = datetime.utcnow()
    
    # Award XP
    GamificationService.award_xp(student_id, 'challenge_completion', challenge.xp_reward)

db.session.commit()
```

### Leaderboard Ranking

```python
# Sort by: completed first, then accuracy, then questions answered
def sort_key(participant):
    return (
        not participant.completed,  # False < True, so completed first
        -participant.accuracy,       # Negative for descending
        -participant.questions_answered
    )

participants.sort(key=sort_key)

# Assign ranks
for i, participant in enumerate(participants, 1):
    participant.rank = i
```
