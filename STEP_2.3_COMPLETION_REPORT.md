**Purpose:** Start a new assessment for the current student

**Authentication:** Required (JWT)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "assessment_type": "diagnostic",  // or "unit_test", "skill_check"
  "grade_level": 5,                 // optional, defaults to student's grade
  "skill_id": 1                     // optional, for skill-specific assessments
}
```

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "assessment": {

    "assessment_type": "diagnostic",
    "grade_level": 5,
    "total_questions": 10,
    "correct_answers": 0,
    "score_percentage": 0.0,
    "completed": false,
    "started_at": "2025-10-17T03:03:27.810511",

## Diagnostic Question Selection Algorithm

### Purpose
Select appropriate questions for diagnostic assessment based on student's grade level.

### Algorithm
```python
def _select_diagnostic_questions(grade_level):
    # Test current grade and 2 grades below (minimum grade 3)
    min_grade = max(3, grade_level - 2)
    grades_to_test = range(min_grade, grade_level + 1)
    
    questions = []
    for grade in grades_to_test:
        grade_questions = get_questions_for_grade(grade)
        # Sample 3-4 questions per grade
        sample_size = min(4, len(grade_questions))
        questions.extend(random.sample(grade_questions, sample_size))
    
    # Limit to 10-12 total questions
    if len(questions) > 12:
        questions = random.sample(questions, 12)
    elif len(questions) > 10:
        questions = random.sample(questions, 10)
    
    return questions
```

### Example for Grade 5 Student
- Tests grades 3, 4, and 5
- Samples 3-4 questions from each grade
- Total: 10-12 questions
- Covers foundational skills

---

## Skills Analysis Algorithm

### Purpose
Identify which skills the student needs to work on based on assessment performance.

### Algorithm
```python
def _analyze_assessment_results(assessment):
    # Group responses by skill
    skill_performance = {}
    for response in assessment.responses:
        skill_id = response.question.skill_id
        # Track correct/total for each skill
        skill_performance[skill_id]['total'] += 1
        if response.is_correct:
            skill_performance[skill_id]['correct'] += 1
    
    # Identify skills below 70% accuracy
    skills_to_work_on = []
    for skill_id, performance in skill_performance.items():
        accuracy = performance['correct'] / performance['total']
        if accuracy < 0.7:
            skills_to_work_on.append({
                'skill': get_skill(skill_id),
                'accuracy': accuracy,
                'questions_attempted': performance['total']
            })
    
    # Sort by accuracy (lowest first)
    skills_to_work_on.sort(key=lambda x: x['accuracy'])
    
    return skills_to_work_on
```

### Example Output
```
Student scored 33% on "Introduction to Fractions" (3 questions)
→ Add to learning path as priority skill
```

- Completed assessments can't be modified

---

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

**404 - Student profile not found:**
```json
{"error": "Student profile not found"}
```

**404 - Assessment not found:**
```json
{"error": "Assessment not found"}
```

**400 - Invalid assessment type:**
```json
{"error": "Invalid assessment type. Must be one of: ['diagnostic', 'unit_test', 'skill_check']"}
```

**400 - Question already answered:**
```json
{"error": "Question already answered"}
```
