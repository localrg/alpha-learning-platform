## Business Impact

### Stakeholder Benefits

**For Parents:**
The parent portal transforms parents from passive observers to active participants in their child's learning journey. Parents gain complete visibility into progress, can communicate directly with teachers, and collaborate on goal-setting. This empowers parents to provide informed support and encouragement at home.
