## 2. Week 8: Advanced Analytics & Polish

### 2.1. Components Delivered

During this final week, we delivered the following key components:

### 2.2. Key Features Implemented

The following key features were implemented as part of the Week 8 work:

*   **Advanced Analytics Dashboard:** The `PlatformMetrics` component provides administrators with a powerful dashboard to monitor the health and performance of the platform. It includes key metrics, user growth trends, engagement statistics, and performance distribution charts. The data can be filtered by time range and exported to CSV or JSON formats.

*   **Global Error Handling:** A global `ErrorBoundary` component was implemented to catch and handle any unexpected errors that may occur within the application. This ensures a graceful failure experience for the user, with options to return to the home page or reload the application.
