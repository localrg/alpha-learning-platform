## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

**Completion Date:** October 2025  
**Step:** 8.1 of 60 (35/60 = 58.3% overall progress)  
**Week:** 8 of 12 (Week 8: 20% complete)

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive parent account system with secure child linking, notification preferences, and multi-child support. Parents can now create accounts, link to their children using invite codes or email requests, and manage notification settings. This provides the foundation for the parent portal and enables parent engagement in their child's learning journey.

## What Was Built

### Parent Account Management

**Parent Model:**
- User ID (links to User table with role='parent')
- Name, email, phone
- Notification preferences (JSON)
- Created/updated timestamps

**Account Features:**
- Create parent account with default notification settings
- Get parent profile by user ID
- Update profile (name, phone)
- Update notification preferences
- 7 notification types with enable/disable and delivery method

**Default Notification Preferences:**
- Daily summary (email, enabled)
- Weekly report (email, enabled)
- Assignment due (email, enabled)
- Low performance (email, enabled)
- Inactivity alert (email, enabled)
- Achievements (email, disabled)
- Quiet hours (22:00 - 08:00)

### Child Linking System

**Three Linking Methods:**

**1. Invite Code (Student-Initiated):**
- Student generates 8-character code
- Code expires in 7 days
- Parent enters code to link
- Link created immediately (pre-approved)

**2. Email Request (Parent-Initiated):**
- Parent requests link by entering child's email
- System finds student account
- Student receives notification
- Student approves or rejects request
- Link created upon approval

**3. Manual Linking (Future):**
- Admin links parent to child
- Used for bulk imports
- No approval needed

**Link Management:**
- View all linked children
- Remove child link (parent-initiated)
- Support multiple children per parent
- Track link status (active, removed)
- Track relationship type (parent, guardian, etc.)
- Set primary contact parent

### Security & Authorization

**Access Controls:**
- Parents can only view data for linked children
- Parents have read-only access to student data
- Parents cannot view other students' data
- Invite codes expire after 7 days
- Duplicate link prevention
- Request approval workflow

**Privacy Features:**
- Link requests require student approval
- Students can reject link requests
- Parents can remove child links
- Expired codes automatically rejected

## Integration Points

### With User Authentication (Week 1)
- Parent accounts use existing User model
- Role='parent' added to User
- Login/logout uses existing auth system
- Password management uses existing system

### With Student Accounts (Week 2)
- Parents link to existing student accounts
- Student data remains in student tables
- Parents have read-only access

### Foundation for Future Steps
- Child progress view (Step 8.2) - Parents will view linked children's progress
- Activity reports (Step 8.3) - Parents will receive reports for linked children
- Communication tools (Step 8.4) - Parents will message teachers about linked children
- Goal setting (Step 8.5) - Parents will set goals for linked children

## User Experience

### Parent Registers and Links Child via Invite Code

1. **Student generates invite code:**
   - Student logs in
   - Navigates to Settings → Parent Access
   - Clicks "Generate Parent Invite Code"
   - System generates code: "EE7HLZOY"
   - Student shares code with parent

2. **Parent creates account:**
   - Parent visits registration page
   - Enters name: "Jane Smith"
   - Enters email: "parent1@email.com"
   - Enters password
   - Clicks "Create Account"
   - Account created with default notification settings

3. **Parent links to child:**
   - Redirected to "Link Children" page
   - Clicks "I have an invite code"
   - Enters code: "EE7HLZOY"
   - System validates code and shows: "Link to Student One?"
   - Parent clicks "Yes, Link Account"
   - Link created immediately
   - Redirected to parent dashboard
   - Sees child's progress overview

### Parent Requests Link by Email

1. **Parent initiates request:**
   - Parent logs in
   - Clicks "Add Child"
   - Selects "Request link by email"
   - Enters child's email: "student2@email.com"
   - Clicks "Send Request"

2. **Student receives notification:**
   - Student sees notification: "Jane Smith wants to link to your account"
   - Student views request details
   - Student clicks "Approve"

3. **Link created:**
   - Parent receives notification: "Link request approved"
   - Parent can now view child's progress
   - Child appears in parent's dashboard

### Parent Manages Multiple Children

1. **Parent has 2 children linked:**
   - Dashboard shows both children
   - Each child has progress overview
   - Parent can switch between children

2. **Parent removes one child:**
   - Parent clicks "Manage Children"
   - Clicks "Remove" next to child
   - Confirms removal
   - Link status changed to 'removed'
   - Child no longer appears in dashboard

## Business Logic

### Invite Code Generation

```python
def generate_invite_code(student_id):
    # Generate random 8-character code
    code = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits, k=8))
    
    # Ensure uniqueness
    while LinkRequest.query.filter_by(invite_code=code).first():
        code = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits, k=8))
    
    # Create link request
    request = LinkRequest(
        student_id=student_id,
        request_type='invite_code',
        invite_code=code,
        expires_at=datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=7),
        status='pending'
    )
    db.session.add(request)
    db.session.commit()
    
    return code
```

### Link Child by Code

```python
def link_child_by_code(parent_id, invite_code):
    # Find and validate request
    request = LinkRequest.query.filter_by(
        invite_code=invite_code,
        request_type='invite_code'
    ).first()
    
    if not request or request.status != 'pending':
        return {'error': 'Invalid or used code'}, 404
    
    # Check expiration
    if request.expires_at < datetime.utcnow():
        request.status = 'expired'
        db.session.commit()
        return {'error': 'Code expired'}, 400
    
    # Check for duplicate
    existing = ParentChildLink.query.filter_by(
        parent_id=parent_id,
        student_id=request.student_id,
        status='active'
    ).first()
    
    if existing:
        return {'error': 'Already linked'}, 400
    
    # Create link
    link = ParentChildLink(
        parent_id=parent_id,
        student_id=request.student_id,
        status='active'
    )
    db.session.add(link)
    
    # Update request
    request.status = 'approved'
    request.approved_at = datetime.utcnow()
    request.parent_id = parent_id
    
    db.session.commit()
    
    return {'success': True, 'link': link.to_dict()}, 201
```
