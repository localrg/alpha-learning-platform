"Don't break your streak!" is more motivating than "Start a streak!"
- Fear of losing progress drives daily return
- Best streak display shows what was achieved before

### Habit Formation
- Daily login/practice creates routine
- 21-day milestone helps establish habit
- Visual reminder (streak display) reinforces behavior

### Goal Gradient Effect
- Progress bars show proximity to milestone
- "Just 2 more days!" creates urgency
- Closer to goal = higher motivation

### Endowed Progress Effect
- Starting at 1 day (not 0) feels like progress
- Best streak shows capability
- "You've done it before, you can do it again!"
