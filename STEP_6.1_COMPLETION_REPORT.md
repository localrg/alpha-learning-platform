## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

**students table additions:**
```sql
bio TEXT
avatar VARCHAR(200) DEFAULT 'ðŸ˜Š'
profile_visibility VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'public'
show_stats BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1
show_achievements BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1
show_activity BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1
```

### Privacy Logic

```python
# Check privacy
is_own_profile = (viewer_id == student_id)

if not is_own_profile:
    if student.profile_visibility == 'private':
        return {'error': 'This profile is private'}

# Add sections based on privacy settings
if is_own_profile or student.show_stats:
    profile['stats'] = ProfileService._get_stats(student_id)
```

### Stats Aggregation

- **Level & XP:** From StudentProgress table
- **Streaks:** From StreakTracking table
- **Skills:** Count from LearningPath (total and mastered)
- **Questions:** Sum of total_questions from all LearningPaths
- **Accuracy:** (sum of correct_answers / sum of total_questions) Ã— 100
