## Sample Content

### Example Skill: Basic Multiplication (Grade 3)

**Description:** Multiply single-digit numbers (0-12)  
**Subject Area:** Arithmetic  
**Mastery Threshold:** 90%  
**Prerequisites:** None

**Sample Questions:**

**Q1 (Medium):** What is 7 × 8?
- Options: [48, 54, 56, 64]
- Correct Answer: 56
- Explanation: "7 × 8 = 56. You can think of it as 7 groups of 8, or 8 added together 7 times."

**Q2 (Hard):** What is 12 × 5?
- Options: [50, 55, 60, 65]
- Correct Answer: 60
- Explanation: "12 × 5 = 60. You can use the trick: 10 × 5 = 50, plus 2 × 5 = 10, so 50 + 10 = 60."

---

### Example Skill: Multiplying Fractions (Grade 5)

**Description:** Multiply fractions by whole numbers and fractions  
**Subject Area:** Fractions  
**Mastery Threshold:** 90%  
**Prerequisites:** Adding Fractions (Skill 5)

**Q2 (Medium):** What is 1/3 × 1/2?
- Options: [1/5, 1/6, 2/5, 2/6]
- Correct Answer: 1/6
- Explanation: "1/3 × 1/2 = 1/6. Multiply numerators (1×1=1) and denominators (3×2=6)."
