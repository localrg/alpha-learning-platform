## Executive Summary

Step 4.4 successfully implements a comprehensive **Worked Solutions System** that provides complete, step-by-step solutions to questions after students have attempted them. This enables students to learn from their mistakes by understanding the complete solution process, identifying where they went wrong, and building correct mental models.

The system automatically generates solutions for multiple question types (multiplication, addition, subtraction, and general), presents them in an engaging step-by-step format, tracks student viewing behavior, and collects feedback to measure effectiveness.

## Sample Solution Output

**Question:** What is 6 √ó 7?

**Generated Solution (5 steps):**

**Step 1: Explanation** üí°  
*Understand what 6 √ó 7 means*  
Multiplication means repeated addition. 6 √ó 7 means adding 6 a total of 7 times.

**Step 2: Calculation** üî¢  
*Set up repeated addition: 6 + 6 + ... (7 times)*  
We need to add 6 to itself 7 times.

**Step 3: Calculation** üî¢ ‚≠ê  
*Perform the addition: 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6*  
Add all the numbers together.

**Step 4: Calculation** üî¢ ‚≠ê  
*= 42*  
This is our final answer.

**Step 5: Check** ‚úì  
*Check: 7 √ó 6 = 42*  
We can verify by switching the order (commutative property). 7 groups of 6 also equals 42.
